-- NB: This example doesn't totally work; we overwrote the
-- old signature H with a new one, which is not the best.

package p where
    signature H(T) where
        data T
    module A(T) where
        import H(T)
    module B(T) where
        data T = T
    signature H(T, f) where
        import B(T)
        f :: a -> a
