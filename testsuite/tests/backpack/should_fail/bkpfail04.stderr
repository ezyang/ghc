bkpfail04.bkp:7:9: error:
    Type constructor ‘A’ has conflicting definitions
    when merging p(hole:A):A into the local requirements,
    Requirement so far: data A = A {bar :: Bool}
      from q(hole:A):A
    New requirement: data A = A {hole:A.foo :: Int}
    The constructors do not match:
      The record label lists for ‘A’ differ
      The types for ‘A’ differ
